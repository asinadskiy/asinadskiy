- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @asinadskiy
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in information security (I have a specialized education) and data science (I just like it).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how neural networks works at DLcouse.ai
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: asinadskiy@yandex.ru (this is not my main email address, so waiting for a response may take a little longer)
- Almost all of my repos are closed due to some form of NDA (or they're not cool enough to share).
